# Repository Split Instructions

Your repository has been prepared to be split into two separate GitHub repositories. All necessary files have been updated to reflect this separation.

## What Has Been Done

✅ **Updated Files:**
- `README.md` - Removed direct references to miner-dashboard, added link to separate repo
- `miner-dashboard/README.md` - Updated to be standalone with proper clone instructions
- `miner-dashboard/package.json` - Updated repository URLs to point to new dashboard repo
- `index.html` - Updated links to point to separate dashboard repository
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Updated to reflect new structure
- Created `split_repos.sh` - Automated script to help with the split
- Created `SPLIT_REPOS.md` - Detailed manual instructions

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Recommended)

1. **Run the split script:**
   ```bash
   ./split_repos.sh
   ```

2. **Create the new GitHub repository:**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name it `quaiminer-dashboard` (or your preferred name)
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Push the dashboard repository:**
   ```bash
   cd ../quaiminer-dashboard-temp
   git commit -m "Initial commit: QuaiMiner Dashboard"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quaiminer-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Remove miner-dashboard from main repo:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspace  # or wherever your main repo is
   git rm -r miner-dashboard/
   git commit -m "Split miner-dashboard into separate repository"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Split

Follow the detailed instructions in `SPLIT_REPOS.md`

## Repository Structure After Split

### QuaiMiner Core (Main Repo)
- ✅ All setup scripts (`*.sh`)
- ✅ Research documentation (`*.md`)
- ✅ Landing page (`index.html`)
- ✅ Simple dashboard (`dashboard/`)
- ✅ GitHub templates (`.github/`)
- ✅ LICENSE and CONTRIBUTING.md
- ❌ `miner-dashboard/` (removed)

### QuaiMiner Dashboard (New Repo)
- ✅ All `miner-dashboard/` contents
- ✅ LICENSE (copied)
- ✅ Standalone README.md
- ✅ Updated package.json with correct URLs

## Important Notes

1. **GitHub URLs**: The files reference `https://github.com/thecrackofdan/quaiminer-dashboard` - update this if your username or repo name differs

2. **History**: The split script creates a new repository without git history. If you want to preserve history, you'll need to use `git filter-branch` or `git filter-repo` (more advanced)

3. **Dependencies**: The dashboard repo is now completely independent and can be installed/updated separately

4. **Links**: All cross-references between repos use GitHub URLs, so they'll work once both repos are pushed

## Verification Checklist

After splitting:

- [ ] Dashboard repo exists on GitHub
- [ ] Dashboard repo can be cloned and `npm install` works
- [ ] Main repo no longer contains `miner-dashboard/`
- [ ] All links in README.md work correctly
- [ ] Landing page (`index.html`) links to dashboard repo correctly
- [ ] Both repos have proper LICENSE files

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `SPLIT_REPOS.md` for detailed manual instructions
2. Review the script output for any errors
3. Ensure both GitHub repositories exist before pushing

Good luck with the split! 🚀
